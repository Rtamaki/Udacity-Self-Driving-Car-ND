# Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-ND

This project contains the main projects done for Udacity 9 months Self-Driving Car Nanodegrees. 
- **Path Planning**: Finding the Optimal Path to a Destination
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Identifying Cars in a Highway
- **Traffic-Sign-Classifier**: Classifying Traffic Signs using different ML Models
- **PID and MPC Controller**: Controlling Car Steering
- **Unscented and Extended Kalman-Filter**: Estimating a Car for Position
- **Capstone Project**: A complete Self-Driving Car

### Disclaimer
These projects were done some years ago and they do not (by far) use the structure, algorithms, or code quality to the solution of the problems as I had much less experience in programming and ML
